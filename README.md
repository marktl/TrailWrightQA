## First-Time Setup

1. Click "Settings" in the top right
2. Choose your AI provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Gemini)
3. Enter your API key
4. Optionally set a default base URL for your tests

## Usage

### AI Live Generation (Recommended)

**Watch AI build your test step-by-step in real-time:**

1. Click "Generate with AI" on the home page
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Starting URL**: Where to begin (e.g., `https://example.com/login`)
   - **Goal**: What to accomplish (e.g., "Register as Jennifer Test_Physician with SSN starting with 123")
   - **Max Steps**: Safety limit (default: 20)
3. Click "Start AI Generation"
4. **New tab opens** showing:
   - Browser automation happening live (headed mode)
   - Each step with QA summary and Playwright code
   - Real-time system logs
   - Current status and progress
5. When complete, click "Save Test" to add to your library

**How it works:**
- AI observes page using accessibility tree
- Decides next action (click, fill, select, etc.)
- Executes action in visible browser
- Records step with QA-friendly summary
- Repeats until goal achieved or max steps reached

### Manual Recording

**Record tests using Playwright Inspector:**

1. Click "Record Test Steps" on the home page
2. Playwright Inspector opens with a browser
3. Interact with your site - actions are recorded automatically
4. Close the inspector when done
5. Name your test and save

### Run Tests

1. Find your test in "Recent Test Sets"
2. Click "Run & Watch" to execute
3. View live progress with step-by-step updates
4. Click "Open Trace" for time-travel debugging

### Manage Tests

- All tests stored as `.spec.ts` files in `~/.trailwright/tests/`
- Edit tests directly or via UI "Edit" button
- Delete tests you no longer need
- Tests are standard Playwright - run them anywhere

## Example Test Scenarios

**Simple Google Search:**
```
URL: https://www.google.com
Goal: Search for "Playwright testing" and verify results appear
Max Steps: 5
```

**Complex Form Workflow:**
```
URL: https://omb.oregon.gov/login
Goal: Register as Jennifer Test_Physician for an MD Active License. SSN starts with 123.
Max Steps: 20
```
